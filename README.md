# Two-Wheeled-Robot

This repository comprises of the ROS implementation of a Two Wheeled Robot. The robot has been simulated on the Robot Operating System (ROS) along with the simple simulation tools like Gazeebo and visualization tools like RVIZ. The robot can be controlled manually using "teleoptwistkeyboard" or we using the obstacle avoidance or the wall following algorithms. Both of the algorithms have been implemented in this project. The ROS version used is ROS Noetic (ROS1) and the linux used in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. 
  
  The project was my J component for the course "Robotics and Automation" in the "Winter Semester 21-22" under faculty "Mr. Sumit Kumar Jindal" at Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore.
